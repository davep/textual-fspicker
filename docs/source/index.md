# textual-fspicker

## Introduction

This library brings a simple set of filesystem-oriented dialogs to
[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io) applications. If you have a need to
give your users a dialog that lets them pick a file for opening, a file for
saving, or they need to pick a directory, this might be the library for you.
